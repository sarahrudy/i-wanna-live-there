  "city_blurb": "Austin has done it again. The Austin-Round Rock metro area is holding steady at No. 1 on the Tech Town Index—its second year in a row in the top spot, rising from No. 3 in 2018. In 2018, we reported 46 tech company relocations to Austin. In 2019, that number increased to 58, according to the Austin Chamber of Commerce, which translated to 4,648 new jobs. Those numbers align with CompTIA’s findings, which show 68,323 IT jobs posted between August 2019 and July 2020—an increase of more than 19,000 over last year. </br> Of course, with exponential growth comes exponential capital. Crunchbase data claims Austin experienced record venture funding in 2019, with local startups raising $1.84 billion for the year, up 19.5% compared to the $1.54 billion raised in 2018, and an impressive 87% increase compared to $983 million in 2017. </br> Where are these companies coming from? Experts say that Austin has become a favorable alternative to the Bay Area and New York City for companies of all sizes that are looking to grow. In fact, the Austin-Round Rock area is home to 5,500 startups and tech companies—leading to many dubbing it the “Silicon Hills.” Google, Facebook, Atlassian and Oracle have thousands of workers in Austin and Apple is making the move to North Austin as well—with potential to add 15,000 more workers to its existing 7,000. </br> Even amid the latest technology boom, the Austin metro area remains one of best places to live in terms of cost of living. Keeping below the national average by about 4%, Austin continues to flex its muscle when it comes to affordability. In fact, there are only three other cities on this list that fare better (Columbus, Atlanta and Huntsville). That’s a bonus for IT pros who earn a median salary of $87,880 here. </br> With major tech players and startups alike calling Austin home, along with great schools, a thriving nightlife and an active, outdoor lifestyle, it’s no surprise that the city has been named the fastest-growing major metro area in the U.S.—and is the reigning No. 1 Tech Town.\n\n",

  "city_blurb": "Jumping from No. 7 last year (and No. 6 in 2018), the sheer number of IT jobs available in Dallas is one of the key reasons for the bump. In the past 12 months, 178,579 IT jobs were posted in the Dallas metro area, including Fort Worth and Arlington. Compared to 146,388 IT jobs posted last year (133,778 at the time of publish), the nearly 32,000+ new jobs posted are proof of the rapid growth potential here. </br> Lockheed Martin and JPMorgan Chase posted the most IT jobs between August 2019 and July 2020. But web, mobile application and software development have formed the core of the IT enterprise ecosystem of the city. In short, the conventional technology enterprises have set the tone for the Dallas tech scene while emerging technology companies are taking it to the next level. </br> IT job growth in the Dallas metro area is expected to grow by 3% to about 176,000 jobs from 2020 to 2021, and by a whopping 11% in the next five years to nearly 190,000 jobs. With the cost of living 2% lower than the U.S. average, more and more young people are putting down roots in this area. With a median IT salary of $94,044, plenty of live music and professional sports teams, tech professionals are finding opportunity and quality of life in Dallas.",

At least that’s what hatch I.T. found when conducting a talent market analysis for a client looking for the optimal location to open another office. Located in the North Carolina Research Triangle, Raleigh is a major east coast tech hub, which explains why it has consistently placed in the top 3 on the index every year. This year, slightly falling from No. 2 to No. 3, Raleigh remains tough to beat. </br> The fact is that talent in this area flock to the startups and the startups need the talent. With multiple universities, including NC State, and plenty of community colleges within throwing distance, a qualified workforce is at the ready. Forbes recently reported that NC State is ranked No. 10 in the nation for entrepreneurship due to its unique programs like the Entrepreneurship Garage and the Entrepreneurship Clinic where students work side-by-side with real-world startups. Over the past five years, NC State has produced more than 170 university startups attracting $1.7 billion in venture capital. </br> And you don’t have to empty your savings to put down roots here. The cost of living in Raleigh is about 4% lower than the national average, with IT pros being paid a median salary of $93,781. The cost of living per month for one person in Raleigh is $2,743. For comparison, Washington, D.C., is $5,206. And that works both ways. Companies doing business in Raleigh enjoy lower operational costs as well.",

  "city_blurb": "The San Jose metro area consistently ranks in the top 5 on the Tech Town Index year after year. This year, falling just a bit to No. 4, San Jose, Sunnyvale and Santa Clara are becoming sought after locales for IT pros for other reasons—namely the pandemic. </br> Data analytics firm Moody found that San Jose may be the city in the best position to welcome an influx of residents fleeing congested cities (like San Francisco) post-COVID-19. In actuality, San Jose has a larger population than its neighbor, San Francisco. But it also has approximately 176 square miles (vs. 49 square miles) to accommodate its residents, giving the area a more suburban feel. And as tech pros adjust to work-from-home policies, the affordability factor becomes even more attractive. </br> Of course, affordability is all relative. Living in San Jose may mean sunshine and access to the Bay, but it also means forking over more of your salary for cost of living expenses. For example, according to Zillow, the median home value in the San Jose area is $1,073,255. While that may seem exorbitantly high, the cost of living in San Francisco is actually higher. IT pros in San Jose are paid a median salary of $137,100, but adjusted for cost of living expenses, that’s really about $93,266. </br> However, with 134,971 IT jobs advertised for in the last year (down from 151,778 in the previous year), the San Jose area is still poised for growth. In fact, jobs are expected to grow by 3% in one year and by 11% in the next five years—numbers that have certainly factored into San Jose's consistently high ranking on the Tech Town Index.",
